What would the bottlenecks in your implementation be as you acquire more users. How you might scale your microservice?

The dictionary of messages that have been sent would run out of memory as usage increases.
I would use a database to store the information.
Then you can scale by using a scalable database (something that can be partitioned across multiple servers such as Redis) and a load balancing scheme to handle high traffic.
